# Financial Model: Stock Price Forecasting Using Linear Regression
Developed a predictive financial model to analyze and forecast stock closing prices over a 3-month period using historical market data and linear regression. Leveraged yfinance to extract daily stock data (e.g., AAPL), engineered time series features such as lagged prices and moving averages, and trained a Scikit-learn Linear Regression model.

Key Features:

Applied time-aware train-test splitting and rolling-window backtesting to simulate real-world forecasting conditions.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² and RMSE metrics, achieving ~78% explanatory power for out-of-sample predictions.

Visualized actual vs. predicted prices to assess predictive trends and volatility.

Demonstrated fundamental understanding of time series preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation best practices.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, yFinance
